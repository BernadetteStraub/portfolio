    <h2 class="text-error-400 my-6 text-3xl">> About Me</h2>
    <p class="text-secondary-400 text-lg text-justify">
        I'm a Fullstack dev currently located in <span class="text-error-400">ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland</span>, who's focus lies in backend development, as you can already tell from my overly simplistic portfolio.
        My passion for coding started from a young age when i started dabbling with HTML and CSS, however I ended up studying for an economics degree because I also liked mathematics.
        Later on I switched studies and graduated with a <span class="text-error-400">Bsc in Business Informatics</span>, which combined both of the things i enjoy, on top of allowing more space for creativity. 
        Throughout my university studies I also completed a 5 month <a href="https://everyonecodes.io/" class="text-error-400 hover:text-primary-400">Spring Boot programme</a> in Vienna, which led me to my first job as a Software Developer.
